# Locker_Project
Algorithms project for St Mary's University in San Antonio that solves the Locker Problem

Locker Problem:
There are n lockers located within a school that all start closed. An equal amount of students go down the line of lockers, opening the ones that are closed and closing the onese that are open. Which lockers they start at and interact with is determined by their student number. An example is student 1 starts at locker 1 and goes down each one, (1, 2 ,3 ,4, ... n) and opens each one up. Student 2 then proceeds, starting at locker 2, interacting each one in the order of (2, 4, 6, 8, ..., n). 

Uses a vector in order to create the line of lockers students proceed through to open or close lockers.
Displays the vector using [[   ]] to symbolize closed and [     ] to symbolize open.
Lists closed and open lockers separately with the count of open lockers shown after the list of open lockers.
